# 📌LinkedIn UI Clone

## Description📑
Welcome to my project which is a UI clone of the LinkedIn platform. I created this project to practice and improve my knowledge 
of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By making a copy of the LinkedIn website's look and feel, I'm getting hands-on experience with 
building web pages and making them interactive. It's like a fun exercise to sharpen my web development skills and learn more 
about how websites work.

## Demo🎥

## Features✨

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the UI is responsive and adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implements interactive elements such as buttons, dropdowns, and modals to replicate LinkedIn's functionality.
- **Styling**: Uses CSS to style the UI elements to closely resemble the visual appearance of LinkedIn.
- **Profile Section**: Includes a profile section displaying user information, connections, and recent activity.

## Technologies Used🛠️
- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling language for customizing the appearance of the UI.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for adding interactivity to the UI.
